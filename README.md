# Image-Classifier-Project-using-PyTorch

In this project, we'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. 
We can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at.
In practice we would train this classifier, then export it for use in our application. 
We'll be using [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories, 
you can see a few examples below.
