# Image-Classifier-Project-using-PyTorch

In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. 
You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at.
In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. 
We'll be using [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories, 
you can see a few examples below.
